Bug reportAppt class Private void isValid()Description:When set the month out of range (greater than 12 or less than 1), that will make function cannot get the correct number of days in month. So, initial the number days in month before checking the correct range of month, which is not correct.How did I find it?I used setStartMonth(int ) function to set up month, if I set the month out of range then the test function will run error. The initial NumDaysInMonth will not get the number.Reasonthe initial for the NumDaysInMonth in the very begging of function, but the function in MunDaysInMonth didn’t have if loop to check if the month in the range, so when the statMonth is out range, the function will run error.Appt classPublic Appt()Description:The beginning function didn’t have set up function, the getValid() function need return false, but actually return true.How did I find it?I set up function Appt appt = new Appt();		    assertFalse(appt.getValid());Reason:it didn’t initial this.valid value.
